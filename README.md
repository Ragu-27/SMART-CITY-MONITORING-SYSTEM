The appendix contains the complete Java source code for the Smart City Monitoring System, which integrates multiple urban monitoring functions into one unified application. The program is developed using Java AWT and follows a modular structure within a single file for portability and ease of execution. The code begins with the main class that launches the login interface, followed by an in-memory database class that stores traffic updates, pollution readings, safety alerts, and citizen complaints. Several GUI components are implemented, including a reusable message dialog box, a secure login window, and a centralized dashboard that provides access to all monitoring modules. Each module—Traffic, Pollution, Public Safety, and Complaints—features its own frame for inserting and managing city data. A generic view frame is used to display stored information in a clean textual format. Overall, the appendix demonstrates how event-driven programming, AWT components, and simple data structures are combined to build an interactive and fully functional smart city management application.
